# 🎓 ISKO SIMULATOR
**Your UPTacloban Adventure in the World of Programming Paradigms**

---

## 📖 Overview  
**ISKO SIMULATOR** is an educational adventure game that simulates the academic journey of a UP student (Isko/Iska). Players explore campus-themed “grounds” while answering quiz challenges based on **programming paradigms**.  

The game blends **theoretical** and **practical** challenges across different difficulty levels. To succeed, players must manage limited lives (🌻 sunflowers) and strategically use coffee-based power-ups (☕ Latte, Macchiato, Americano).  

This project is developed as a **Machine Problem for CMSC 13: Surveys of Programming Paradigms** at UP Tacloban.
